# Online Store Written in C# and Using ASP.NET Core MVC
An online store to display products from independents.

# Brief
### A while back my brother designed the concept for the store:
https://shopindie.8px.design/

With this as a start, the core brief was to rebuild it using the aforementioned tech stack. The website needs to:

###### Products Page

- Display all Products
- Order Products by Price and Name
- Filter Products by 'Product Category' and 'Product Selection'
- Products have a 'Details' section that opens a new page with additional info

**status: complete**

###### Shopping Basket

- Allow user to add/remove a Product to a basket
- Allow basket to store selected items throughout the user's session
- Allow user to increase and decrease stock volume from within the basket
- Ensure the basket's running total updates automatically

**status: complete**

###### Submit Product

- Allow a logged in user to submit a product to the database
- Also, allow the user to upload an image from their own computer to the system to support the submission

**status: complete**

###### Store Product in a Database

- Store all uploaded products to an SQL Server

**status: complete**

###### Authentication & Authorization

- Utilise a Sign-up/Login system
- Create a heirachy of Authorization with different tiers of user: SuperAdmin, Admin & GeneralUser.

**status: complete**

###### Admin Area

- Allow users with certain Authorization levels access to an admin area where they can
  - Delete/Edit products
  - Delete/Edit Users

**status: complete**
